Game Jam Guru
=============

This is a small app designed to help people generate game ideas in a time-constrained game jam type setting. It lets you choose constraints like Theme, Gameplay, Art Style, etc., and then selects a random option for each of the chosen constraints (like the Urbanspoon UI).

Uses the awesome cross-platform UI framework [www.kivy.org](Kivy) and will run on Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android, but is being designed with mobile in mind.
